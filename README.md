## Overview
Welcome to the Language Learning Translator! This project is designed to help language learners effectively memorize vocabulary using scientifically-backed techniques: Active Recall and Spaced Repetition. Our platform not only translates words and phrases but also saves them for future revision, ensuring that you never forget what you've learned.


## Features
- Never Forget New Words: Every translation is saved for future revision.
- Master Vocabulary Faster: Active Recall strengthens memory retention.
- Smart Learning Schedule: Spaced Repetition ensures you revise at the right time.
- Audio + Text: Listen and read for a full-language experience.
- Personalized Learning Journey: Review cards based on your difficulty level.

  
## How It Works
1.Translate & Save: Every translated word, sentence, or phrase is automatically stored with text and audio.
2.Flashcard System with Active Recall:  flashcards challenge you to recall the meaning—boosting memory retention actively.
3.Spaced Repetition for Long-Term Retention:
- Hard words? Revise them the same day.
- Medium-difficulty words? Revise after 1 day.
- Easy words? Revise after 4+ days, depending on your past performance.
4.Smart  Scheduling: The system adjusts your revision schedule automatically based on how well you remember each word.

  
## The Science Behind It
1. Active Recall: Actively trying to remember information strengthens neural connections, making it easier to retrieve later. Our flashcards force your brain to recall words instead of just recognizing them.
2. Spaced Repetition: Spacing out revision sessions is key to tackling the forgetting curve. Hard words are shown frequently, while easier ones appear less often, ensuring maximum retention with minimum effort.
   
## Who Is This For?
✅ Language learners who struggle to retain new vocabulary.
✅ Busy individuals need an efficient way to memorize phrases.

## What I learned :grinning:

Since learning a language is an interest to me. This project was a great experience to practice how to transform ideas into software features. I learned how to develop faster by applying an iterative approach to adding project features. Besides practising the Django framework. I also learned  about integrating asynchronous  calls with Django in running translating libraries and Designing a better utility function that handles file storage.
